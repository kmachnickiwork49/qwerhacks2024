    <!-- Rather than an HTML element, it would make sense for the page
      to detect user text input automatically. No input box visual.
      The text just expands from center of the page like typing into
      a center-aligned input area. But rather than rendering just text,
      the page is generating the text as (groups of) physics objects.
      Time is frozen while the user is typing, until they press ENTER.
      Then time for the simulation starts. Simulation does not end until
      web page reloads. -->
    <!-- Simulation details: stretch goal, multiple fun simulation modes. 
      But the basic should be fall, hit bottom of the page, and shatter.
      Basically every letter is a bunch of 2D objects. They cannot overlap
      and they all accelerate to the bottom of the screen. Normal force
      stops them from falling. So it should look like a pile of junk once
      blocks generally end up motionless. -->
